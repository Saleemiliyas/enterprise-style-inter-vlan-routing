# # Enterprise-Style Inter-VLAN Routing

This project demonstrates inter-VLAN routing in an enterprise-style network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer. It focuses on logical network segmentation with VLANs and enabling Layer 3 communication between them through routing.

## Network Topology
- Multiple VLANs representing different departments  
- Switches configured for VLAN segmentation  
- Layer 3 device configured to route traffic between VLANs  

## Key Configurations
- VLAN creation and assignment  
- Trunk configuration between switches  
- Layer 3 routing between VLANs  
- Default gateway configuration  

## Verification
- Verified VLAN isolation at Layer 2  
- Tested inter-VLAN communication using ICMP (ping)  
- Confirmed correct routing between VLANs  

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Outcome
This lab demonstrates foundational networking skills relevant to entry-level Network Support and NOC roles.
